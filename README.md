## Design
### Colour Scheme
The website harmoniously blends warm tones of light coral and red-orange with accents of light grey and white, all anchored by a cool grey undertone. This carefully curated color scheme establishes a sense of vibrancy and professionalism while ensuring a visually engaging experience for the users.
The main colours set as variables are

    1. --orange: #f58669;
    2. --dark-orange: #de502c;
    3. --white: #ffff;
    4. --brown: #63453d;
    5. --background: #ebeae5;
    6. --gray: #938c8c;

The below colours were used to compliment the main colours. Due to the fact that these colours have been used with very little repetition, there was no need to set them as variables
- #6f6a6a
- #2b221f
- #333
- #0d0d0d
- #888
- #97908e
- #eeebe3

![Colour Scheme](./assets/readme-images/colour-schema.PNG)
### Database Schema
![database schema](./assets/readme-images/database.png)

1. User:
The User model is part of Django Allauth. The model comes with predefined fields as standard. Some of them are username, email, name, password, and more. This model is used for user authentication, hence why changes directly to this model are not advisory. The User model is connected to the UserProfile model with one to one relationship.

2. UserProfile:
The UserProfile model is a custom custom-created model to handle the user profile details. Signals are used to reflect the changes between the User and UserProfile models.

3. Category
This model was created for the purpose of defining categories for the products

4. Genre
This model was created to add genre section for the products. It is connected to Category with a ForeignKey

5. Author
This model stores the infor for each author. It consist of name, image, bio and id.

6. Book
This is a custom product model. It is connected to Genre as a ForeignKey and author as ManyToManyField. This allows adding more than one author per book. In addition to that it has fields for handling stock. Stock_amount holds the integer value of the stock levels. In_stock is a Boolean field which sets the product to being in stock or not. A method called product_in_stock determines if a product is in stock based on the stock_amount value. The result of this method updates the in_stock boolean field. 

7. Wishlist
This model stores the books or products to a wishlist for authenticated users. It is connected to UserProfile and Book models as a ForeignKey

8. ProductReview 
This model stores the user's reviews for a product. It is connected to the UserProfile and the Book models as a ForeignKey

9. Order 
This model holds all the information of the user's order. It is connected to the UserProfile as a ForeignKey.

10. OrderStatus
This model is connected to the Order model with OneToOneField. When an Order is created a signal creates OrderStatus. The default value is 'in progress' with additional options of Completed and Cancelled. 

11. OrderLineItem
This model is connected to the Order and Book as a ForeignKey. It is created for each item in the order

12. DiscountCode
This model has no specified relationship to the other models. It contains three fields - code, discount and active. It allows the admin to create discount codes, determine the amount of a discount and if the code is active. 

### Fonts
In addition to Bootstrap 5 built in font family the below two fonts were used throughout the application
1. Poppins

![Poppins](./assets/readme-images/font-poppins.PNG)
2. Libre Baskerville

### Wireframes
### Agile Methodology
#### Overview
This project was created using agile principles. As this is my second full-stack project, using agile, it was easier to identify the relevant milestones. Using the agile approach allowed me to plan all the features of the website through user stories. Each user story has acceptance criteria and tasks to clearly outline the requirements for each feature to be completed.

#### Epics(Milestones)
The user stories are grouped into eight EPICS or Milestones. An additional Milestone called Project Backlog was created to manage any additional features, bugs, or tasks that may arise during development.

![Milestones](./assets/readme-images/milestones.PNG)

#### User Stories Issues
The structure of the user story issue consists of the user story, acceptance criteria, and tasks that outline the steps that are required for this issue to be completed. During development where possible, the commit messages are connected to their corresponding issues.

![User Story](./assets/readme-images/user-stories.PNG)

![User Story](./assets/readme-images/commits.PNG)

#### MoSCoW prioritization
This prioritization technique was used to effectively prioritize the features and requirements of the project based on their importance. The acronym "MoSCoW" stands for "Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have." Each category helps categorize and prioritize features to guide the development process and ensure that the most critical elements are addressed first.

![MoSCoW](./assets/readme-images/moscow.PNG)

#### GitHub Projects
The project was created using a basic Kanban Board structure, divided into columns such as Todo, In Progress, Done, and Backlog. This setup provides a clear and organized way to track the status of tasks and visualize and manage the workflow.

![Project](./assets/readme-images/agile-project.PNG)

## Features
#### Navbar
The navbar was built using bootstrap 5 and it is fully responsive. The search bar allows the users to search for products by keywords from any page of the website. The My Account drop down gives the user the option to log in or sign up. If the user is authenticated additional menu options are displayed like my profile and admin (if the user is a superuser). The shopping cart icon is a link to the shopping cart and it also displays the total of the items in the cart.
The nav links allow the user to refine the products by category, genre, special offers or to browse through the authors page, FAQ and about us. The is a dropdown for special offers which allows the user to see the new arrivals and deals.

![navbar desktop](./assets/readme-images/features/nav-mobile.PNG)

![navbar desktop](./assets/readme-images/features/nav-open-mobile.PNG)

### Toasts
Toasts from Bootstrap were implemented to provide customers with feedback regarding their actions on the website.

![toasts](./assets/readme-images/features/messages.PNG)

### Breadcrumbs
The implementation of breadcrumbs allows users to keep track of their current location on the website. Breadcrumbs are present on most pages throught the website including the products pages. They are located on the top left corner of the page.

![breadcrumbs](./assets/readme-images/features/breadcrumbs.PNG)

#### Footer
The footer consist of links to social media, business address and useful links including about us, faq, privacy policy and the main product categories

![footer](./assets/readme-images/features/footer.PNG)

### Home Page
#### Hero Section
The hero section is the beginning of the whole customer's journey. That is why I made it a priority to create appealing hero section. 
The text on the left communicates the essence of BookHeaven, portraying it as a Dublin-based family business offering a diverse range of books for different audiences
The hero section image was designed using photoshop by combining images of book covers. The added shadows made the hero section blend well with the rest of the website.
This is then followed by call-to-action button Shop Now which invites the user to browse through the available products.

![hero section](./assets/readme-images/features/hero-section.PNG)

#### Trust Badges
The trust badges serve as visual indicators to reassure the visitors about specific aspects of the services available. Animation effect was added to the icons to make them more eye catching.

![trust badges](./assets/readme-images/features/trust-badges.PNG)

#### Products
The products displayed on the home page are the most recently added 8 products which are in stock.

![products](./assets/readme-images/features/products-home.PNG)

#### Newsletter
The users can sign up to a newsletter to recieve the most recent offers and discount codes. The form was integrated using MailChimp.

![newsletter](./assets/readme-images/features/newsletter.PNG)

### Products Page
The all books page renders all products to the user. They have the option to sort the products by title, price, genre and category. This page also displays the number of the products available. The pages, which refine the products by category or genre render the same template as all products, prefilled with the relevant data.
At the end of the products result there is pagination to help the user navigate easily through multiple pages of products

![pagination](./assets/readme-images/features/pagination.PNG)

![all products](./assets/readme-images/features/all-products.PNG)

### Products Card
The product card consist of an image of the book cover, title, author and price. When hovered over the add to cart button appears at the bottom and a heart at the top to add to favourites. If the product is on sale, then the old price will be displayed with line through, followed by the new price and a little label at the top of the image showing the percentage of the discount.

![product card](./assets/readme-images/features/card.png)

![product card sale](./assets/readme-images/features/card-sale.PNG)

### Single Products Page
On the page's left side, a product image is displayed. On the right side, the most important information about the product is displayed. This includes the title, author, publisher, reviews rating, price, stock levels, add to wishlist icon, and add to cart button with quantity dropdown. 
Implementing stock levels in the product model, allowed for adding custom logic when it comes to adding items to the cart. The user should not be able to add to their cart a higher quantity than the stock levels and this logic also needs to account for items already in the cart. If the user tries to add more than what is in stock an error message appears to notify that there is not enough stock to fulfill the order.
Below the top section, there is a section with tabs allowing the user to switch between description, details, and reviews. The reviews section allows an authenticated user to submit a review for a product. The overall rating is calculated and the number of starts are displayed in the top section of the page. Authenticated users can edit and delete their reviews from the same tab. 
The description tab includes a short description of the book which helps the users in making informed decision if they wish to purchase this book
The details tab includes some book information like ISBN number, number of pages, and language.

Below that the admin is presented with a button to add products which leads to the product creation page. This is followed by a drop-down offering the ability to refine by stock with the options of in-stock, low-stock, or out-of-stock.
A table with all the products is displayed below showing the title of the product and general stats like price, reviews, on sale, and stock amount. The admin is also presented with the action buttons to edit and delete products.
The stock level field clearly indicates the level of stock by using green colour for in stock, yellow colour for low stock (items with 5 or under units), and red for items out of stock.

#### Orders Admin
The orders page in the admin section provides a breakdown of the order stats based on status.
Below that there is a drop-down offering the ability to refine by order status. The options are In Progress, Completed, Cancelled, and All.
Below that the orders are displayed in a table with the order number, date, amount of items, order total, and status. The status field clearly indicates the status of the order. The used colours are red for canceled, green for completed, and blue for in progress. The admin can edit the order status by using the pencil icon on the side of each row.

About the order status feature:
    The orders, when created have a default status of In Progress. When developing this feature the initial idea was to add a status field to the order model. This led to some issues with the form when making a purchase. After some investigation the error was related to the fact that this field is not rendered on the checkout page or handled when making a purchase, however in the model blank was set to False as default. By allowing blank to be True this resolved the submission issue. Later on in the development process, I came up with a better solution. The order status was created as a separate model, which is connected to the order with the One-to-one relationship. When an order is created, signals are used to create the OrderStatus. Separating the status from the order allows for easier manipulation of the status field without the need to handle the rest of the fields in the order.

Admin Orders;

![admin orders](./assets/readme-images/features/admin-orders.PNG)

![admin orders refine](./assets/readme-images/features/admin-orders-refine.PNG)

#### Edit Order Status

![edit order status](./assets/readme-images/features/admin-order-edit-status.PNG)

#### Admin Discount Codes
This page has similar layout to the orders and dashboard. It presents the admin with a breakdown of the number of discount codes on the system by status.
There is a button to create code which opens a modal with the creation form. The discount code consist of the code, the amount of the discount in percentage and a checkbox to determine if the code is active or not.
The discount codes can be editted and deleted from this section without the need of using Django admin.

## Deployment
### Before Deployment
To ensure the application is deployed correctly on Heroku it is mandatory to update the requirements.txt. This is a list of requirements that the application needs in order to run.

- To create the list of requirements we use the command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt. This will ensure the file with the requirements is updated.
- Then commit and push the changes to GitHub.

! Before pushing code to GitHub ensure all credentials are in an env.py file, which is included in the .gitignore file. This tells Git not to track this file which will prevent it from being added to Github and the credentials being exposed.

### Stripe setup
- Log in to [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie)
- Navigate to developers section (link located at the top right)
- Go to API keys tab and copy the values of PUBLIC_KEY and SECRET_KEY and add them to your env.py file
- Navigate to the Webhooks page from the tab in the menu at the top and click on add endpoint.
- This section requires a link to the deployed application. The link should look like this https://your_website.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/ 
- Choose the events the webhook should recieve and add endpoint.
- When the application is deployed, run a test transaction to ensure the webhooks are working. The events chan be checked in the webhooks page.

### AWS setup
- Log in to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
1. Create a new S3 bucket:
- Choose the closest AWS region.
- Add unique bucket name.
- Under Object Ownership select ACLs enabled to allow access to the objects in the bucket.
- Under Block Public Access settings unselect block all public access as the application will need access to the objects in the bucket.
- Click on create bucket.
2. Edit bucket settings.
